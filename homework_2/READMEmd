# Module Homework 2 - Cohort 2025

## Assignment

So far in the course, we processed data for the year 2019 and 2020. Your task is to extend the existing flows to include data for the year 2021.

## Assignment answer

In this case I used Kestra running in local with docker:

```
 docker run --pull=always --rm -it -p 8080:8080 --user=root -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /tmp:/tmp kestra/kestra:latest server local
```

And us Kestra backfill since January to July 2021 and using GCP with GCS and Bigquery. Code for this: https://github.com/ramirovazq/ramiro-data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/KESTRA_orchestration/kestra_using_gcp Backfill was done for yellow ant green taxi data

## Quiz Questions

1. Within the execution for Yellow Taxi data for the year 2020 and month 12: what is the uncompressed file size (i.e. the output file yellow_tripdata_2020-12.csv of the extract task)?

### TODO paste image but image has 128.3MB
#### 128.3MB

2. What is the rendered value of the variable file when the inputs taxi is set to green, year is set to 2020, and month is set to 04 during execution?


{{inputs.taxi}}_tripdata_{{inputs.year}}-{{inputs.month}}.csv
* inputs.taxi = 'green'
* inputs.year = '2020'
* inputs.month = '04'
* {{green}}_tripdata_{{2020}}-{{04}}.csv

#### Answer
green_tripdata_2020-04.csv

3. How many rows are there for the Yellow Taxi data for all CSV files in the year 2020?

```
