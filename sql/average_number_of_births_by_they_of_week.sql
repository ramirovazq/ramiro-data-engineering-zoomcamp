-- in the playground.us_birth_stats table. Cast the average as an integer. 
-- Order the results by the day of the week.

-- These are the tables to query for this question:
-- playground.us_birth_stats

--     year int
--     month int
--     date_of_month int
--     day_of_week int

--     day_of_week integer
--     average_births integer

SELECT 
  day_of_week,
  CAST(AVG(births) AS INTEGER) AS average_births
FROM playground.us_birth_stats
GROUP BY day_of_week
ORDER BY day_of_week
