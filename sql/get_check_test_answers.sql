-- Check Test Answers
-- Create a SQL query to evaluate test answers stored in a table named playground.answers with columns id (unique question ID), correct_answer (string), and given_answer (which can be NULL). Return a table with columns id and checks, where checks is "no answer" if given_answer is NULL, "correct" if given_answer matches correct_answer, and "incorrect" otherwise. Order the results by id.
-- These are the tables to query for this question:
-- playground.answers
--     id int
--     correct_answer string
--     given_answer string
-- Your answer should include these columns:

--     id integer
--     checks varchar

SELECT
  id,
  CASE
  WHEN given_answer IS NULL THEN 'no answer'
  WHEN given_answer = correct_answer THEN 'correct'
  WHEN given_answer != correct_answer THEN 'incorrect' 
  ELSE 'other' END AS checks
FROM playground.answers
